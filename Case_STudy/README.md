## Getting Started

"Campus#" is a case study from Group 2 of CS-102 for 6PROGSDATS Finals.

This project is a simple console-based application that allows users to create and 
manage a list of students, their courses, and their grades. The application should use object oriented 
principles to design and implement the classes and methods for the system. The application should also 
handle exceptions and errors appropriately and provide user-friendly messages.

Menu is the java class to open from which is located under `\src\`.


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder contains java classes
- `lib`: the folder contains dependencies such as OpenCSV.

`database.csv` is located under `\..\database.csv` from this README.md file and holds the student database. 

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
